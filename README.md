# Handy JavaScript Code Snippets

I am adding some **JavaScript code Snippets** that I find useful, structured and come handy to programmers when they write code.

These include basic usage snippets like :
- Function that return first three letters of a month. **ex:** `Jan`, `Feb` etc.,
- Function that return Suffix for Dates in a month by taking the date value as number. **ex:** `23th`, `18th` etc.,

As of now, I am adding two functions
1. `getMonthName()`,
2. `appendDateSuffix()`

> The above JS functions can be found in *snippets.js* file and I am including *styles.css* and *index.html* in case one wants to download this folder and play with the code.

*I will update the repo whenever possible and add something useful to all of us*

**Happy coding!** :+1:
